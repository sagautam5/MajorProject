Machine Learning In Identifying Dementia In MRI Scans

Main purpose of the project is to identify dementia in MRI scan using machine learning algorithm. Training images are preprocessed to determine features and based on these features Neural Network and K Nearest Neighbour model has been developed which predicts dementia in MRI scans.
